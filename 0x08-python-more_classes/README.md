Object-Oriented Programming (Please be careful: in most of the following paragraphs, the author shows the way you should not use or write a class, in order to help you better understand some concepts and how everything works in Python 3. Make sure you read only the following First-A The __Data Abstraction, Data Encapsulation, and __str__- and __Public- Protected- and )

classmethods and staticmethods
Properties vs. Getters and Setters (Mainly the last Public instead of Private )
